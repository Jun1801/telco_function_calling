Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. TDD Workflow (Mandatory for Non-Trivial Changes)

**Use RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. No silent shortcuts.**

- **RED**: Add or update a test that fails for the bug/behavior first.
- **GREEN**: Implement the smallest change that makes the test pass.
- **REFACTOR**: Improve structure only after tests are green, without changing behavior.

Rules:
- For bug fixes and logic changes, do not implement before proving failure with a test (or explicit reproducible script when tests are unavailable).
- Keep each TDD cycle small; avoid mixing multiple behavior changes in one cycle.
- When touching existing behavior, add at least one regression case.
- If tests are missing in a module, add focused tests nearest to the changed behavior.

## 6. Practical SOLID Guardrails

**Apply SOLID pragmatically, not ceremonially.**

- **SRP (Single Responsibility):** each module/function should have one primary reason to change.
  - If a function both decides policy and does low-level I/O, split responsibilities.
- **OCP (Open/Closed):** prefer extending via composition/config over editing many call sites.
  - Add new strategy/path using existing extension points before adding condition chains.
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution):** alternative implementations must preserve behavioral contract.
  - If a replacement changes required inputs/outputs, it is not a drop-in substitute.
- **ISP (Interface Segregation):** keep interfaces small; do not force consumers to depend on unused methods.
  - Prefer narrow protocol/adapter boundaries around hot paths.
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion):** business logic depends on abstractions/factories, not concrete constructors scattered in flow code.
  - Reuse existing factories/providers in the repo instead of inline instantiation.

## 7. Definition of Done (Engineering Checklist)

A change is done only when all are true:
- Behavior is validated (tests pass, or explicit reproducible verification if test infra is unavailable).
- At least one regression check exists for the changed bug/edge case.
- Diff stays within requested scope; no unrelated cleanup/refactor.
- No new dead code/imports introduced by the change.
- Logs/errors remain actionable (no swallowed exceptions without context).

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, clarifying questions come before implementation, and bug fixes arrive with reproducible tests.
